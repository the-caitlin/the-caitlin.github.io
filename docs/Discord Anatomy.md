## Discord Anatomy
This section defines various Discord terms that will be referred to throughout this document. Below are images breaking down your view of Discord on PC.

![Servers are listed vertically all the way to the left of the screen, and Chats/DMs are listed vertically just to the right of servers](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1fWxedk-g.png)

#### Chat/Direct Message
A way to communicate with members 1:1 or in a small group. Chats are generally more private (you're not sending messages to potentially hundreds of people). Displayed below is a chat to a single user:

You can access direct messages by clicking on the button with the discord logo in the upper-left corner of the screen.

#### Profile
This is your Discord account. You use it to join servers and DM others. Your profile is also customizable. Find more information on customizing a profile on [this Discord page](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403147417623-Custom-Profiles).


#### Server
The subject of this guide! Made of multiple channels. Much more feature-rich than text chats. May have moderators, roles, and apps. You can find a list of their icons on the left side of your screen.

Below is an image of the server itself and a breakdown of the main features.

#### Channel
Similar to a chat, but exists inside a server so that you, and all of your members, can communicate with each other. There are 2 types of channels that are most commonly used in club servers on Discord: **Voice** and **Text**. 

* **Voice :** Allows you to connect with other members by having live voice (and video) conversations with up to 99 members. Voice channels don't require you to start a call, you just click on the channel to join it. Additionally, members can choose to have their microphone and camera enabled or disabled for privacy.

* **Text :** Allows you to connect with other members by texting them. Text channels are like group chats, but you can specifically mention people by using the **@** key, followed by the person's username. 

![Text channels are denoted by a "#" to the left of the channel name.](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkRIFSWyWx.png)

You can also create different channels on Discord (more on this later...) to keep conversations more organized or only allow certain members, such as club leaders, to send messages in a channel.

#### Roles
A way to organize members and grant permissions. Discord's system for roles uses colors (ex: red = the lowest group, purple = administrator, etc). Users with multiple roles will only display the color of their highest role. You can also manage roles (this will be discussed later on in the document).
 
!!! note
    The administrator role has the highest number of permissions. Make sure you assign this role appropriately!
