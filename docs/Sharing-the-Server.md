## Sharing the Server
Now that you have a working server, you'll want to get your club members in! There are two methods to get club members in your server: invite links, and QR codes.

### On PC
#### Evergreen Invite Link
This is where we will teach you how to create a permanent invite link to easily share your server with others. 

1. Click on the name of your **discord server**. You should see these list of options:

2. Click on the **Invite People** option. If you have been using Discord before, you'll see a list of friends on Discord as well as any group chats you're in. **Invite People** is the 2nd option in the dropdown
3. There will also be a "Or, send a server invite link to a friend". It looks like this:
