## Roles and Permissions
Your members will have different club roles such as:

* Club Officer
* Special Roles
    * ex: writer vs actor for a film
* Member Status
    * ex: active/unactive member or members with paid/unpaid dues

### How to Make Roles
1. Press the **server name** in the upper-left corner. 
2. Select **Server Settings**
3. Navigate to the **Roles** tab and select **Create Role**.
4. Under **Role Name**, write an appropriate name for this role. This will be displayed to all discord users. 
**(Optional)** Under **Role Color** select a color for this role. Users's names that have this particular role will be displayed in this color.
5. Save changes to confirm your selection.

### Server Permissions

Discord follows a top-down structure for permissions. This means that members can only affect users with roles lower than their highest role. Base permissions are already given to all members automatically, but this doesn't account for role specific permissions. The following section will describe the most useful permission types to give to club officers, or other higher up roles, and then break down how to apply them.

**I. Administrator Permission**
Administrator is the most powerful role as it grants all permissions to the assigned role. This permission should be used with caution. This position is recommended for the club leader, or the club officer responsible for running the discord.

**II. Manage Roles**
Users with this permission can create and modify roles positioned below their own. They cannot assign any permissions to individuals at their own level or higher, nor assign any permissions that they themselves have not been granted. This role is recommended for club officers.

**III. Manage Messages**
The role with this permission can delete messages sent by other members or pin any message. This permission is recommended for club officers, or other members responsible for moderating the server. 

**IV. Manage Expressions**
Users with this permission may edit or remove custom emoji, stickers and sounds in this server. This permission is recommended for club officers, or other members responsible for moderating the server. 

**V. Kick, Approve, and Reject Members**
Users with this permission can kick other members from this server. Kicked members may rejoin the server if they have another invite. If the server enables Member Requirements, this role can also approve or reject members from joining the server.

**VI. Ban Members**
Allows the role with this permission to permanently ban other members and delete their message history.

**Other Permissions**
There are many more discord permissions built into the application. If you have a specific permission you wish to grant, consult the [Permissions on Discord](https://discord.com/community/permissions-on-discord-discord) webpage.
