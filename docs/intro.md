# Intro to Discord
### Getting Started
This section will show you how to download Discord and create an account. Discord can be used on the website, but it is recommended that you use the app to have access to more features. 

#### On PC
To create an account using your desktop, go to the [Discord website](https://discord.com/) and scroll down to where it says **Download for [name of your operating system]** (i.e "Download for Windows"). Follow the download directions.

#### On Mobile
To create an account using your phone, go to the App Store or Google Play and search for "Discord". Hit the **download** button. Once downloaded, hit the **Open** button, this will open the app on your phone.

### Creating an Account
If you are not logged in already, you will need to log in or create an account. To start this, click the **Register** button. You'll be prompted to enter an email, display name, username, password, and birth date.

An email will be sent to the account you used for registration. Click the **Claim Account** button. This will claim your account. After claiming your account, a 5 digit number will appear after your username. This is a unique number used to differentiate your account from others.
