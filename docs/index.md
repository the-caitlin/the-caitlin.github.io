# Discord for VT Clubs

Are you a part of student club leadership at Virginia Tech? Looking for a messaging platform that works for clubs big and small? Discord offers means of both mass and personal communication: channels to separate conversations based on topics, roles to separate your officers from regular members, and multiple ways to share your server with new members.

Welcome to the "Discord for VT Clubs" user guide. This guide will outline how to use Discord for your VT club from creating an account to setting up special roles for your club officers.

Discord offers a large variety of features, not all of which will be covered in this guide. This guide takes a streamlined approach, cutting out all of the unnecessary noise of current discord documentation. Instead, it focuses only on the essentials of club communication. 

>[!Note]
>Although you can use the mobile app to set up your server, this guide focuses on how to setup a server using the desktop application.

# Intro to Discord
### Getting Started
This section will show you how to download Discord and create an account. Discord can be used on the website, but it is recommended that you use the app to have access to more features. 

#### On PC
To create an account using your desktop, go to the [Discord website](https://discord.com/) and scroll down to where it says **Download for [name of your operating system]** (i.e "Download for Windows"). Follow the download directions.

#### On Mobile
To create an account using your phone, go to the App Store or Google Play and search for "Discord". Hit the **download** button. Once downloaded, hit the **Open** button, this will open the app on your phone.

### Creating an Account
If you are not logged in already, you will need to log in or create an account. To start this, click the **Register** button. You'll be prompted to enter an email, display name, username, password, and birth date.

An email will be sent to the account you used for registration. Click the **Claim Account** button. This will claim your account. After claiming your account, a 5 digit number will appear after your username. This is a unique number used to differentiate your account from others.
