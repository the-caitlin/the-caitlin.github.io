# Discord for VT Clubs

Are you a part of student club leadership at Virginia Tech? Looking for a messaging platform that works for clubs big and small? Discord offers means of both mass and personal communication: channels to separate conversations based on topics, roles to separate your officers from regular members, and multiple ways to share your server with new members.

Welcome to the "Discord for VT Clubs" user guide. This guide will outline how to use Discord for your VT club from creating an account to setting up special roles for your club officers.

Discord offers a large variety of features, not all of which will be covered in this guide. This guide takes a streamlined approach, cutting out all of the unnecessary noise of current discord documentation. Instead, it focuses only on the essentials of club communication.

    Although you can use the mobile app to set up your server, this guide focuses on how to setup a server using the desktop application.
