## Moderation
### Virginia Tech
Any club communication is an extension of the club. Even online, your club leadership and members are subject to the [Virginia Tech Principles of Community](https://www.vt.edu/principles-of-community.html) as well as the [Virginia Tech Honor Code](https://www.registrar.vt.edu/content/dam/registrar_vt_edu/documents/governance/2015-2016/HONOR-CODE-MANUAL-10-9-15.pdf). It's important to make students aware of this, for example with a message in a dedicated #rules channel. The tone of the club might be casual, but it's a bad idea to risk your server becoming known as a den of--gasp!--*academic dishonestly.* If it's easy to join your server, your club members should be reminded that it's easy for people to join the club and read what they're saying.

### Discord
Your club will also be subject to the [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). Familiarize your club officers with these, here are the most important restrictions:

* Don’t use the services to do harm to yourself or others.
* Don’t use the services to do harm to Discord. 
* Don’t use the services to do anything else that’s illegal.

### Your VT CLub
Before using Discord for club communication, talk over the rules and regulations of Discord, the university, and your club. Decide on boundaries, disciplinary actions, and who is responsible for executing these.
If club leadership decides that a member should no longer be in the Discord server, see this [Discord guide](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360055478831-Move-Members-and-Disconnect) on how to remove members from a server.
