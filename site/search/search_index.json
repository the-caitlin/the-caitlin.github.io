Text channels are like group chats, but you can specifically mention people by using the @ key, followed by the person's username.  </p> <p>You can also create different channels on Discord (more on this later...) to keep conversations more organized or only allow certain members, such as club leaders, to send messages in a channel.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"discord_anatomy/#roles","title":"Roles","text":"<p>A way to organize members and grant permissions.
